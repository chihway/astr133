# ASTR 13300 Introduction to Astrophysics

Welcome to the ASTR 133 repository (repo). In this repo we will store some class demos for the class and give (some of) you a first taste of coding in Python in a Jupyter notebook environment.

[Here](Setting_up_on_midway_and_jupyter.pdf) are instructions on how to get started. 

We will not go through the other activities in class, though you are welcome to check them out on your own.

We also include a set of simple python tutorials in **Tutorials** that you can play with.
