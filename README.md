# astr133

Welcome to the Spring 2019 ASTR 133 repository. In this repo we will store some class demos for the class and give (some of) you a first taste of coding in a Jupyter notebook environment.

A couple steps to get you set up and oriented:

1. Direct your browser to https://jupyter.rcc.uchicago.edu/, you will be situated at your home directory. It should be pretty empty. 

2. Go to the upper right corner, click on "New" and choose "Terminal" in the pulldown menu. A black box will open, this is the terminal where you can operate as in a Linux environment. You can find some basic Linux commands here: https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners, though we won't need much of these in the class.

3. Type `pwd` to figure out where you are (i.e. your home directory). Checkout the shared matherial for the class at `/project2/astr133` by typing `ls /project2/astr133`. 

4. We like you to "clone" this repo into your home directory so you can play with it on your own. To do this, make sure you are in your home directory, and type `git clone https://github.com/chihway/astr133.git`. Now close the tab with the terminal, and you will find a folder `astr133` in the original tab.
