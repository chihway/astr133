# ASTR 13300 Introduction to Astrophysics

Welcome to the Spring 2019 ASTR 133 repository (repo). In this repo we will store some class demos for the class and give (some of) you a first taste of coding in Python in a Jupyter notebook environment.

[Here](Setting_up_on_midway_and_jupyter.pdf) are instructions on how to get started. 

This year, we have two activities in this class that will be done using this interface: 
* **Week 3:** we use a web-based interface to solve some stellar sturcture equations and learn to make simple plots of the output files.
* **Week 4:** we learn how the HR diagram of globular clusters mean and how to fit the characteristics of the globular clusters using its HR diagram. 

We will not go through the other activities in class, though you are welcome to check them out as well.

We also include a set of simple python tutorials in **Tutorials** that you can play with.
