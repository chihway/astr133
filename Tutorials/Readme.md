* Introduction to python programming: https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110. The course is estimated to be about 5 weeks and so hopefully won't be too much time.

* Similar to the JupyterHub we will use in this class, you can also try this browser-based notebook interface: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
